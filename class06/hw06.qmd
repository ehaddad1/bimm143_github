# The function analyze_protein() generates a plot for the input protein, which 
# plots the protein's residues in relation to their B-factors. The input is the
# PDB ID of the protein of interest and the output is a plot. To use the
# function, just call the function with the PDB id of your protein of interest.

# Arguments (1)
#   id (string) : PDB Protein Entry ID 

# Output (1)
#   Plot of the protein's residues in relation to their B-factor 

analyze_protein <- function(id) {
  protein <- read.pdb(id)
  protein.chainA <- trim.pdb(protein, chain="A", elety="CA")
  plotb3(protein.chainA$atom$b, sse=protein.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
}


analyze_protein("4AKE") # kinase with drug
analyze_protein("1AKE") # kinase no drug
